Parmfile Documentation:

In the parmfile: any parameter may be changed. Also the order can be changed.

The name of the parameter file can be entered in the cmd line: -prm <string>

IMPORTANT: no parameter can be left blank. Need to make robust.
IMPORTANT: The number of spaces cannot be changed. Keep to the format.

POP_1_SIZE = [any positive integer]: Size of population 1 
POP_2_SIZE = [any positive integer]: Size of population 2
INITIAL_UTTERANCES = [any positive integer]: The Number of exemplars at the beginning
CROSS_INTERACTION = [float between 0 and 1]: How much of the conversations are between the populations   
NR_OF_INTERACTIONS =  [any positive integer]: how much interactions are there in one run
PRINT_EVERY_N = [any positive integer]: How often is the result printed.
DO_REMOVE_EXEMPLARS = 0 (False) or 1 (True). : Do the exemplars need to be removed?
DOUBT_STEP = [any positive float]: How big are the doubt steps
DOUBT_INFLUENCE = [any positive float]: How much does the doubt weigh?
N_RUNS = [any positive integer]: the number of times the experment must be repeated
USE_SIGMOID = 1,2,0: 
	1 = use weighed average of "classical probs" and sigmoid probs.
	2 = only use sigmoid probs
	0 = only use 'classical probs'

G_VF = [any positive float]
G_THEN = [any positive float]

USE_DEATH = 1,2,0
	1: agents die when they are out of exemplars
	2: agents die after N interactions
	0: agents do not die
	
DIE_AFTER_N = [any positive integer]. IS ONLY RELEVANT WHEN USE DEATH = 2. This parameter determines after how many interactions an agent dies.

GEN_2_START = float between 0 and 1. At what percentage of the epochs does a new generation start 
GEN_3_START = float between 0 and 1. At what percentage of the epochs does a new generation start
